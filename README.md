# To be or not to be true
This is my version of the Geo Quiz application which is the first tutorial application for the book, <strong>Android Programming</strong> <i>The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</i>.

It is a simple quiz application that present questions to the user and allows them to choose true or false.  The user may also elect to cheat if they do not know the answer and the answer will be revealed to them, however it will remind them they cheated when they go back and answer the question.
